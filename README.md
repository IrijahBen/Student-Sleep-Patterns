# Student Sleep Patterns Dataset

## Overview
The **Student Sleep Patterns Dataset** explores the sleep behaviors of university students, analyzing correlations between sleep duration, sleep quality, and various lifestyle factors. The dataset is **synthetically generated** to simulate realistic trends and relationships while ensuring anonymity and privacy. It is intended for **educational and research purposes**.

## Data Description 
The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanjamal002/student-sleep-patterns) contains **500 rows** (students) and **14 columns**, where each row represents a unique student, and columns describe attributes related to their sleep patterns and lifestyle.

### Columns:
- **Student_ID**: Unique identifier for each student (integer).
- **Age**: Age of the student in years (integer).
- **Gender**: Gender of the student (categorical: 'Male', 'Female', 'Other').
- **University_Year**: Current year of university (categorical: '1st Year', '2nd Year', '3rd Year', '4th Year').
- **Sleep_Duration**: Total hours of sleep per night (float).
- **Study_Hours**: Average number of hours spent studying per day (float).
- **Screen_Time**: Average number of hours spent on screens (excluding studying) per day (float).
- **Caffeine_Intake**: Average number of caffeinated beverages consumed per day (integer).
- **Physical_Activity**: Average minutes spent on physical activity per day (integer).
- **Sleep_Quality**: Subjective rating of sleep quality on a scale of 1 to 10 (integer, 1 = worst, 10 = best).
- **Weekday_Sleep_Start**: Time the student typically goes to sleep on weekdays (float, 24-hour format, e.g., 23.00 = 11 PM).
- **Weekend_Sleep_Start**: Time the student typically goes to sleep on weekends (float, 24-hour format).
- **Weekday_Sleep_End**: Time the student typically wakes up on weekdays (float, 24-hour format).
- **Weekend_Sleep_End**: Time the student typically wakes up on weekends (float, 24-hour format).

## Potential Research Questions
This dataset can be used to investigate various research topics, including:
- The relationship between sleep duration and academic performance (proxied by study hours).
- The impact of screen time on sleep quality and duration.
- Correlations between caffeine intake and sleep patterns.
- The influence of physical activity on sleep quality.
- Differences in sleep patterns based on gender or university year.
- Predictive modeling of sleep quality based on lifestyle factors.

## Limitations
- **Synthetic Data**: The dataset is artificially generated and does not perfectly reflect real-world complexities.
- **Subjective Measures**: Sleep quality is self-reported and may not fully capture sleep health.
- **Limited Variables**: Factors like stress levels, diet, and sleep disorders are not included but could significantly impact sleep patterns.

## Usage
This dataset is designed for **educational and research purposes**. Users can leverage it for data analysis, modeling, and visualization while acknowledging its synthetic nature. Proper citation of this documentation is appreciated.
